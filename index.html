    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[there is diffrent measurments we can use to protect the website from treats. one is Sanitization of data this means ensuring that the data a system accepts is in the right format. This can be done manually or by using a well-known third-party solution. For example, in NodeJS, you have the sanitize-html package for sanitizing HTML code. have a strong password, the password should contain at leat 12 characters a mixture of both upper and lowercasee letters , it shoudl have numbers and at leaste one special character.Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration is an automatic process of integrating and delivering code to production. Usually, CI/CD runs every change against some security checks and decides the delivery of the change to productions. Any change that does not pass the checks would be rejected and flagged for a rework. It basically catches oversights from developers and helps maintain the reliability of the changes coming to a codebase.</p>
